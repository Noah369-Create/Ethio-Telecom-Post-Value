## Project Description: 
## Driving Customer Retention Through Churn Analysis in Ethio-Telecom
- This project focuses on analyzing customer churn patterns in Ethio-Telecom following the introduction of enhanced value-added services. The goal is to identify factors contributing to customer churn, predict at-risk customers, and design effective retention strategies to improve customer satisfaction and boost revenue.

## Key highlights of the project include:

### Data Collection and Integration
- Consolidated customer data from multiple sources, including service usage logs, billing records, and CRM systems.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Conducted comprehensive analysis to uncover churn trends, usage behaviors, and correlations with new services.
### Predictive Modeling:
- Built machine learning models to accurately predict customers at high risk of churning.
### Customer Segmentation:
- Grouped customers based on churn risk and engagement with value-added services to enable targeted interventions.
### Retention Strategy Development:
- Proposed and evaluated data-driven strategies, such as personalized offers and loyalty rewards, to reduce churn rates.
### Business Impact Measurement:
- Analyzed the effectiveness of value-added services in improving retention and increasing overall customer lifetime value.
### Visualization and Reporting:
- Designed interactive dashboards and detailed reports for stakeholders to support strategic decision-making.
